### About The Project

This is a weather app made using HTML, Jquery, and Bootstrap. This is ready to use the script but I recommend you to use your own API. I have subscribed to a free API.So it doesn't allow many more requests than a paid one. Although, You can access current weather data for any location including over 200,000 cities.

You can get You own API from  https://openweathermap.org/price

You can modify and distribute it.
